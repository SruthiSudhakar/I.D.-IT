# I.D.-IT
We used a preexisting template on GitHub for the Google Cloud Vision API to create a website that runs on Google's App Engine Server. The code we used was in python, and built with Flask. The website takes in an image, and returns a json with information about the objects in the image. Then, we created an iOS app using Swift, which allowed a user to select an image from their photos library to upload into the app. The app then sent the image through a "POST" request to the website and returned a json, which we then extracted data from in order to display the object identified in the image by the Google Cloud Vision API. The user then has the option to conduct a Google search on the identified object by pressing a button, which opens Safari.
